For the output devices week, I wanted to work with LED strips. My goal was to make a device that changed colours in sync with my hand tapping a beat on the table. 

# The setup

First things first I had to figure out how to program the LED strip on its own. I connected it to Pin 9 of the ItsyBitsy using a 1k resistor.

# The code

```C

import time
import audioio
import board
import digitalio
 
button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.A1)
button.switch_to_input(pull=digitalio.Pull.UP)
 
wave_file = open("LoudYell.wav", "rb")
wave = audioio.WaveFile(wave_file)
audio = audioio.AudioOut(board.A0)
 
while True:

    print("Waiting for button press to continue!")
    while not button.value:
        audio.play(wave)

    while audio.playing:
        pass
    print("Done!")  
```
