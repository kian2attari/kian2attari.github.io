For the output devices week, I wanted to work with LED strips. My goal was to make a device that changed colours in sync with my hand tapping a beat on the table. 

# The setup

First things first I had to figure out how to program the LED strip on its own. I connected it to Pin 9 of the ItsyBitsy using a 1k resistor.

# The test code

To test the strip, I used some simple code to light up the LEDs one-by-one sequentially:

```C

#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN        9 
#define NUMPIXELS 10 
#define DELAYVAL 50 // Time (in milliseconds) to pause between pixels

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(20); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)
}

void loop() {
  strip.clear(); // Set all pixel colors to 'off'

  // The first NeoPixel in a strand is #0, second is 1, all the way up
  // to the count of pixels minus one.
  for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...

    // strip.Color() takes RGB values, from 0,0,0 up to 255,255,255
    // Here we're using a moderately bright green color:
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 150, 0));

    strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.

    delay(DELAYVAL); // Pause before next pass through loop
  }
}
```

Now it's time to make my light breakdancer!

# Adding the Piezo sensor

I wired up a Piezo sensor with a 1M resistor to pin A1

# The real code

I prefer using Python, so I installed CircuitPython onto the ItsyBitsy. 

The following code takes reading from A1, converts it to a voltage, and then changes the color of the strip if the reading crosses a certain threshold. After a bunch of testing, I put it in this loop with a delay of 0.1 because this setup made it so that the light changes were very fast and responsive but still visible to the human eye.

```python 

import time
import board
import neopixel
from analogio import AnalogIn

RED = (255, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)

pixel_pin = board.D9
num_pixels = 10
piezo_in = AnalogIn(board.A1)
# We set autowrite to false so we must use show to explicitly send the code
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(pixel_pin, num_pixels, brightness=0.05, auto_write=False)


def get_voltage(pin):
    return (pin.value * 3.3) / 65536

while True:
    piezo_val = get_voltage(piezo_in)
    if (piezo_val < 3) :
        pixels.fill(RED)
        pixels.show()
    else:
        pixels.fill(GREEN)
        pixels.show()

    print((get_voltage(piezo_in),))
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

# The final result!
