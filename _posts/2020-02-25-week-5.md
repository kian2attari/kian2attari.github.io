This week, we did 3D printing. I took a 3D scan of my head and then 3D printed it. I also designed and 3D printed a spring!

## Making the spring!

I lasercut the parts for a box with a hinge.

I glued the box lid together for more security. The rubber band just keeps everything together as it dries.

## Cleaning up the spring

Due to the extensive supports, there was a lot of cleanup involved. Very difficult cleanup.

I took off the major pieces with pliers, but everything waw still rough.

I then used an exacto knife to slice off more of the support and finally used sandpaper to smooth it all down.
