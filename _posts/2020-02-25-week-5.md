This week, we did 3D printing. I wanted to make a minimalist bobblehead of myself.

## Making the spring!

## Cleaning up the spring

Due to the extensive supports, there was a lot of cleanup involved. Very difficult cleanup.

I took off the major pieces with pliers, but everything waw still rough.

I then used an exacto knife to slice off more of the support and finally used sandpaper to smooth it all down.

## Scanning my head

I tried using the Artec 3D Space Spider to get a scan of my head but it was unable to get a good scan and captured too much noise. 

Knowing that the iPhone X has a built-in infared depth camera for the Face ID feature, I ended up using my phone to take the scan of my head. I tried a number of different apps, but the one that worked best was Bellus 3D -- which specializes in face scanning.

After a couple hours of trial and error, here is the result!

## The verdict on additive vs subtractive methods

While removing the supports was a definite pain, I don't think these pieces could have been made nearly as easily with subtractive methods. The spring in particular has a ton of empty space in between which would be hard for say a CNC machine to do. Additionally, PLA was an excellent material to make the spring out of as it was the right balance between firmness and flexibility.
