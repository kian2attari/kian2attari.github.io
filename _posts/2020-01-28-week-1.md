I programmed the ItsyBitsy M4 to blink its light!

Here's the software that blinks the light on the ItsyBitsy M4!

![The software!](https://i.ibb.co/v1VCQyx/Screen-Shot-2020-02-04-at-3-24-12-PM.png)

I customized the code to customize the blinking pattern a bit and make it more chaotic:

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1500);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1200);                       // wait for a second
} 
```
