This week, I created my very own press fit kit.



## The first attempt
Coming soon

## My own design!
After my first run through, I designed my very own press fit kit. The design consisted of four elbow pieces with 2 slits each, and a circular piece with four slits that acted as a connector. I'm quite proud of this design because it's very space efficient and uses nearly 100% of the area that's cut out of the material.

The fit between the pieces was perfect!

Once I seperated all the pieces, I had just enough to make this weird moose-creature!

The modularity of the wonderful design allowed for two versions of the moose. Here's chubby moose.

More pictures of the sketching processes for my final press-fit kit design to come very soon!




## What I'd do better next time:

I should've used filleting on the corners of my shapes so that they'd be rounded out and have a smoother fit.
