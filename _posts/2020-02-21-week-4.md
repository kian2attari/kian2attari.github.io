This week, I designed a box with a very sleepy and angry man in the box. If you open the box and let in the light, he will scream at you.

## Making the box

I lasercut the parts for a box with a hinge.

I glued the box lid together for more security. The rubber band just keeps everything together as it dries.

## Making the speaker

Connecting the speaker directly to the Arduino produces a very very low sound because the ItsyBitsy cannot provide the current necessary to produce a loud sound. This means I need to amplify the sound!

I first use a wave generator as my amplifier. I connected the Arduino's audio output on A0 to the input port of the wave generator and then plugged up the output of the amplifier to the speaker.

And here's how it sounds!

And when the voltage threshold (about 1.72 v) is hit, the box screams!
