For my final project, I have three main ideas.

My first one would be to make a motorized catapault that uses computer vision to identify targets, adjust the pitch and yaw to aim at the target, 
and then launches at them. Alternatively, the catapault could just be remote controlled to remove the need for computer vision.

A variation on the catapault idea would be a machine that aims and shoots ketchup at the target as they come into view.
