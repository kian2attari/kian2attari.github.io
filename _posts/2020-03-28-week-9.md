This week, I use WiFi to control a stepper motor remotely.

# The setup

I got the boards up and running. I  used two seperate instances of the Arduino IDE to control each one

# The stepper motor

The Huzzah uses 3.3v output for its logic, so I can't use it to directly connect to the input pins of the Stepper driver as that expects a 5v input. Since I don't have a logic level converter nor the parts needed to make one, I'm gonna use an Arduino Uno to connect to the Stepper drivers. The Huzzah would then communicate through the Uno to drive the stepper motor

## The Uno code

Here's the basic code I used to get the Uno to control the stepper.

```c
// Include the Arduino Stepper Library
#include <Stepper.h>

// Number of steps per output rotation
const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;

// Create Instance of Stepper library
Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 8, 9, 10, 11);


void setup()
{
  // set the speed at 80 rpm:
  myStepper.setSpeed(80);
  // initialize the serial port:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() 
{
  // step one revolution in one direction:
  Serial.println("clockwise");
  myStepper.step(stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(500);

  // step one revolution in the other direction:
  Serial.println("counterclockwise");
  myStepper.step(-stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(500);
}
```



# Forging a body

First, I install a connector piece onto each one of servos so that I can secure them to the body frame.

The frame I'm using for the body is a simple camera mount from an old project. The holes allow me to secure the servos onto them well. I also use a little bracket on the inside to hold the middle servo in place. This makes it so that the large bracket moves instead of the servo itself. The middle servo controls the body of the dancer while the servo at the bottom controls the neck. You'll see what I mean soon.
